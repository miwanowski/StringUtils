## Scala String Utilities

This is my Scala String Utilities project. With hope, I'll add more documentation
as time goes on.

(A funny thing about Scala is that I keep thinking that maybe I need a StringUtils
class, and then when I realize how easy the solutions are, I realize I don't 
need one. See the current 'truncate' method as an example.)
